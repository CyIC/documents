NOW, THEREFORE IT IS AGREED:

   the laws of the State of Texas.

2. Name. The name of the partnership shall be Cypress Investment Club. 

3. Term. The partnership shall begin on 9 February 2018 and shall continue in perpetuity until 
   terminated as hereinafter provided.

4. Purpose. The only purpose of the partnership is to invest the assets of the partnership solely 
   in stocks, bonds and other securities ("securities") for the education and benefit of the 
   partners.

5. Meetings. Periodic meetings shall be held as determined by the partnership.

6. Capital Contributions. The partners may make capital contributions to the partnership on the 
   date of each periodic meeting in such amounts as the partnership shall determine, provided, 
   however, that no partner's capital account or partner’s combined household accounts shall exceed
   twenty-five percent (25%) of the capital accounts of all partners.

7. Value of the Partnership. The current value of the assets of the partnership, less the current 
   value of the liabilities of the partnership, (hereinafter referred to as the "value of the 
   partnership") shall be determined as of a regularly scheduled date and time ("valuation date") 
   preceding the date of each periodic meeting determined by the Club.

8. Capital Accounts. A capital account shall be maintained in the name of each partner. Any 
   increase or decrease in the value of the partnership on any valuation date shall be credited or 
   debited, respectively, to each partner's capital account on that date. Any other method of 
   valuating each partner's capital account may be substituted for this method, provided the 
   substituted method results in exactly the same valuation as previously provided herein. Each 
   partner's contribution to, or capital withdrawal from, the partnership shall be credited, or 
   debited, respectively, to that partner's capital account.

9. Management. Each partner shall participate in the management and conduct of the affairs of the 
   partnership in proportion to his capital account. Except as otherwise determined, all decisions 
   shall be made by the partners whose capital accounts total a majority of the value of the 
   capital accounts of all the partners.

10. Sharing of Profits and Losses. Net profits and losses of the partnership shall inure to, and be
    borne by, the partners, in proportion to the value of each of their capital accounts.

11. Books of Account. Books of account of the transactions of the partnership shall be kept and at 
    all times be available and open to inspection and examination by any partner.

12. Annual Accounting. Each calendar year, a full and complete account of the condition of the 
    partnership shall be made to the partners.

13. Bank Account. The partnership may select a bank for the purpose of opening a bank account. 
    Funds in the bank account shall be withdrawn by checks signed by any partner designated by the 
	partnership.

14. Broker Account. None of the partners of this partnership shall be a broker. However, the 
    partnership may select a broker and enter into such agreements with the broker as required for 
	the purchase or sale of securities. Securities owned by the partnership shall be registered in 
	the partnership name unless another name shall be designated by the partnership.

    Any corporation or transfer agent called upon to transfer any securities to or from the name of
	the partnership shall be entitled to rely on instructions or assignments signed by any partner 
	without inquiry as to the authority of the person(s) signing such instructions or assignments, 
	or as to the validity of any transfer to or from the name of the partnership.

    At the time of a transfer of securities, the corporation or transfer agent is entitled to 
	assume (1) that the partnership is still in existence and (2) that this Agreement is in full 
	force and effect and has not been amended unless the corporation has received written notice to
	the contrary.

15. No Compensation. No partner shall be compensated for services rendered to the partnership, 
    except reimbursement for expenses.

16. Additional Partners. Additional partners may be admitted upon the unanimous consent of the 
    partners, so long as the number of partners does not exceed limits determined by the 
	partnership.

	a. Transfers to a Trust. A partner may, after giving written notice to the other partners, 
	   transfer his interest in the partnership to a revocable living trust of which he is the 
	   grantor and sole trustee.

	b. Removal of a Partner. Any partner may be removed by agreement of the partners whose capital 
	   accounts total a majority of the value of all partners' capital accounts. Written notice of 
	   a meeting where removal of a partner is to be considered shall include a specific reference 
	   to this matter. The removal shall become effective upon payment of the value of the removed 
	   partner's capital account, which shall be in accordance with the provisions on full 
	   withdrawal of a partner noted in paragraphs 18 and 20. The vote action shall be treated as 
	   receipt of request for withdrawal.

17. Termination of Partnership. The partnership may be terminated by 	agreement of the partners 
    whose capital accounts total a majority in value of the capital accounts of all the partners. 
	Written notice of a meeting where termination of the partnership is to be considered shall 
	include a specific reference to this matter. The partnership shall terminate upon a majority 
	vote of all partners' capital accounts. Notice of the decision to terminate the partnership 
	shall be given to all the partners. Payment shall then be made of all the liabilities of the 
	partnership and a final distribution of the remaining assets either in cash or in kind, shall 
	promptly be made to the partners or their personal representatives in proportion to each 
	partner's capital account. 

18. Voluntary Withdrawal (Partial or Full) of a Partner. Any partner may withdraw a part or all of 
    the value of his capital account in the partnership and the partnership shall continue as a 
	taxable entity.

	The partner withdrawing a part or all of the value of his capital account shall give notice of 
	such intention in writing to the Secretary. Written notice shall be deemed to be received as 
	of the first meeting of the partnership at which it is presented. If written notice is received
	between meetings it will be treated as received at the first following meeting. Withdrawal may 
	only take place after the first six months of a partner’s admission.

	In making payment, the value of the partnership as set forth in the valuation statement 
	prepared for the first meeting following the meeting at which notice is received from a partner
	requesting a partial or full withdrawal, will be used to determine the value of the partner's 
	account.

	The partnership shall pay the partner who is withdrawing a portion or all of the value of his 
	capital account in the partnership in accordance with paragraph 20 of this Agreement.

19. Death or Incapacity of a Partner. In the event of the death or incapacity of a partner (or the 
    death or incapacity of the grantor and sole trustee of a revocable living trust, if such trust 
	is partner pursuant to Paragraph 16A hereof), receipt of notice shall 	be treated as a notice 
	of full withdrawal.

20. Terms of Payment. In the case of a partial withdrawal, payment may be made in cash or 
	securities of the partnership or a mix of each at the option of the remaining partnership. In 
	the case of a full withdrawal, payment may be made in cash or securities or a mix of each at 
	the option of the remaining partners. In either case, where securities are to be distributed, 
	the remaining partners select the securities.

	The partnership shall transfer to the partner (or other appropriate entity) withdrawing a 
	portion or all of his interest in the partnership, an amount equal to the value of the capital 
	account being withdrawn, less any actual expenses to the partnership related to the withdrawal.
	Payment may be made by transferring cash or securities or both. The value of securities 
	transferred shall be as shown on the Club's valuation statement prepared to determine the value
	of that partner's capital account in the partnership and securities shall be transferred as of 
	the date of that valuation statement (the "withdrawal valuation date"). The Club's broker shall
	be advised that ownership of the securities has been transferred to the partner as of the 
	withdrawal valuation date. Cash shall be paid within 10 business days after the withdrawal 
	valuation date.

	If the partner withdrawing a portion or all of the value of his capital account in the 
	partnership desires an immediate payment in cash, the partnership at its earliest convenience 
	may pay eighty percent (80%) of the estimated value of his capital account and settle the 
	balance in accordance with the valuation and payment procedures set forth in paragraphs 18 and 
	20.

21. Changes to this Agreement. Modifications and amendments to this agreement shall be enforceable 
	only by agreement of partners whose capital accounts total a two-thirds majority in value of the 
	capital accounts of all the partners.

22. Forbidden Acts: No partner shall:

	a. Have the right or authority to bind or obligate the partnership to any extent whatsoever 
	   with regard to any matter outside the scope of the partnership purpose.

	b. Except as provided in paragraph 16A, without the unanimous consent of all the other 
	   partners, assign, transfer, pledge, mortgage or sell all or part of his interest in the 
	   partnership to any other partner or other person whomsoever, or enter into any agreement as 
	   the result of which any person or persons not a partner shall become interested with him in 
	   the partnership.

	c. Purchase an investment for the partnership where less than the full purchase price is paid 
	   for same.

	d. Use the partnership name, credit or property for other than partnership purposes.

	e. Do any act detrimental to the interests of the partnership or which would make it impossible
       to carry on the business or affairs of the partnership.

and personal representatives of the partners for the Cypress Investment Club.
